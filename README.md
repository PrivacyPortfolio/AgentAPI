# PrivacyAgentAPI
draft specification

Help develop national and global standard APIs for Third-Party Privacy Services! 

We need to expand integration between Consent Management/DSAR platform providers, Privacy Agents, Enforcement Authorities, and individual consumers/data subjects. We need automation to improve data quality and integrity. We need to make authentication and authorization services accessible to everyone. This API, designed for individual consumers and their agents, will benefit all stakeholders.

Specs for this API could be derived from:

ISO 27001:2013 controls
NIST (Zero-Trust Architecture, other SPs)
Privacy Laws (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)
Company policies and DPAs
Agents ( capability to provide feedback and request features )
